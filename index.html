                Ye (/jeɪ/ YAY; born Kanye Omari West, June 8, 1977) (/ˈkɑːnjeɪ/ KAHN-yay), commonly known by his birth name, 
                is an American rapper, record producer, and fashion designer.[3][4][5] He is widely regarded as one of the 
                most influential rappers of all time. Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, he gained recognition as a producer 
                for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for several artists and developing the "chipmunk soul" 
                sampling style. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he released his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), 
                to critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music.

             Graduation (2007), and 808s & Heartbreak (2008). Drawing inspiration from maximalism and minimalism respectively, his fifth album My

             his discography also includes the full-length collaborative albums Watch the Throne (2011) with Jay-Z and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Kid
